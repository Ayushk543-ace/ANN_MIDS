        "data=\"Twenty years ago, I dug a hole at a fever pitch while on a beach in South Padre Island, Texas. It was a shallow hole, but enough to contain vomit full of beer and Lunchables that I’d deposited into the trench. After wiping my mouth and scooping sand over the puke, I stood triumphant and raised a fist to a chorus of cheers. I’d just beer-bonged three Miller Lites on a challenge.For the uninitiated, beer bonging is when you pour beer into a funnel attached to a long piece of plastic tubing and then consume the alcohol as fast as possible. This process leaves you unbelievably drunk, but it’s a rite of passage among many college students. Granted, I couldn’t keep the liquid down, but the other college co-eds found the feat impressive.A few months earlier, I’d returned from the military’s Defense Language Institute, where I’d picked up another language. In search of a break from college and military routine, I joined my brother and a group of friends for Spring Break. My brother was the first to greet me post vomit escapade and slapped my increasingly pink shoulder, then handed me an ice-cold beer. I gratefully accepted and rinsed my mouth with the cold liquid.\""
